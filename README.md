# Cars-shop
https://cars-sales-shop.herokuapp.com/

Cars-shop is a MPA(multi-page application) application builded with express using server-side rendering.
The project is build upon the MVC design pattern.
For database I am using noSQL mongoDB cluster database(not local).
For view engine I am using express-handlebars.
The back-end is using some extra libraries for hashing passwords and creating json web tokens on register/login (bcrypt , jsonwebtoken).
The front-end part of the application is created with bootstrap and custom SASS.

* In the application you can register/login and buy/sell cars also add some of them to favourites if you want to look them up later.
* Every user starts with default 20000 dollars , so it's just a virtual shop :)
