Cars-shop is a MPA application builded with express with dynamic server-side rendering views. I am using the MVC design pattern for creating it.
For database I am using noSQL mongoDB cloud database. The back-end is using some extra libraries for hashing passwords and creating json web tokens
on login (bcrypt , jsonwebtoken ). The front-end part of the application is created with bootstrap and custom SASS.
